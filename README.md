Experimenting with open source APIs and parsing their outputs with Python (using requests library)
- Streaming APIs
- (Long) Polling

**Goals:** To learn API retrieval fundamentals, be able to pass parameters of my choosing to query an API, and to be able to process and handle the output response. This is highly valuable when needing to build an application on top of a microservice architecture and extremely useful when gathering data in real-time (or almost real-time) to ingest into a database. I have a deeper satiable desire to understand api-retrieval libraries from a fine-grained perspective while also improving my skills in data manipulation and extraction.

I have taken the notes below to help me understand how to replicate this setup. 
## Getting Started


### TODO:
- Using a cache to store the data (perhaps Redis)
- Handling time-data formats
